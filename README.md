# ImproveProject

The original project called ' Build a ROTATING flight widget with JavaScript! ' can be seen on YouTube following the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs5aOs-Wpxw&t=39s It takes only 37:56 minutes!

I chose this project because I want to improve it and addind two clock - analogic & digital - who switch one into another after a certain period of time.

Basically, I add a switch clocks callback function very used in JavaScript programming!
